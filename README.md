# slicing-in-python
 [start : stop : steps]  
which means that slicing will start from index start
 will go up to stop in step of steps. 
 Default value of start is 0, stop is last index of list
 and for step it is 1 .
The slice() constructor creates a slice object representing the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step).
slice() Parameters.slice() mainly takes three parameters which have the same meaning in both constructs:
1.start - starting integer where the slicing of the object starts
2.stop - integer until which the slicing takes place. The slicing stops at index stop - 1.
3.step - integer value which determines the increment between each index for slicing
